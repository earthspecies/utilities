# dl-annotator - a cross platform application for annotating audio recordings

This application aims to streamline the annotation process, allowing the user to create an annotation with the press of the space bar while listening to audio recordings.

Annotations created with this method will not be precise to within miliseconds, but for many deep learning applications, this will be more than good enough.

The output file can be read as a selection table into Raven.

**Please note:** this is a very early version of the software - there might be bugs and the functionality is very limited. If there is a feature you are looking for, please give us a shout!

## Instructions on running the application

There are no binaries available at the moment. To run the application, you need to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed. To run, clone the repo, cd into it and execute `npm install && npm start`.
