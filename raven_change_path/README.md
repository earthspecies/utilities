## Modify path in a sound selection table in Raven

In Raven, sound selection tables offer a much sought after functionality - you can annotate files using offsets calculated from beginning of a file (instead of from beginning of the sequence of files). Unfortunately, there is a twist to this - you need to specify absolute path to your files in the sound selection table txt file.

If you are cooperating with someone and you share the files with them, they need to go in and manually modify the sound selection table file. That is a tedious and error prone process. This application automates the modification.
